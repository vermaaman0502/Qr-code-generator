I learned about CSS cool shake animation and how to set their keyframes.

@keyframes shake{
    0%{
        transform:translateX(0);
    }
    25%{
        transform: translateX(-2px);
    }
    50%{
        transform: translateX(0);
    }
    75%{
        transform: translateX(2px);
    }
    100%{
        transform: translateX(0);
    }
}
